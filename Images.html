	<h2>Images</h2>
		<p>An image is a binary representation of visual information such as drawings, pictures, graphs, logos, or individual video frames<sup>[6]</sup>. Image compression is minimizing the size in bytes of a graphics file<sup>[7]</sup>. 
		Compression can be either lossless or lossy. Lossless compression retains all information whereas lossy compression intentionally discards some information.


	<h3>The Difference Between Lossless and Lossy Compression on Images.</h3>
		<p>With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is uncompressed. All of the information
		is completely restored. Lossy compression reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information, especially redundant information<sup>[8]</sup>.


	<h3>Why Is It Important For Web Designers To Compress Image Files?</h3>
		<p>There are many reasons why a web designer would want to compress image files, these can include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>big files can make your pages load too slowly<sup>[9]</sup></li>
				<li>search engines can add "load time" to their algorithms, this means that if a site takes too long to load, they will be penalised<sup>[9]</sup></li>
				<li>people with dial-up would not be able to easily load them<sup>[9]</sup></li>
			</ul>
	
	<h3>The Effects of Lossless and Lossy Compression</h3>
		<p>Both lossless and lossy compression can result in the loss of quality, while both can significantly reduce the file size.</p>
		
	<h3>Lowering the Quality</h3>
